# This code was used to develop and evaluate machine learning models for the prediction of 1-year thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm life-altering events following thoracic endovascular aortic repair and complex endovascular aneurysm repair using the Vascular Quality Initiative Database in the manuscript entitled "Using machine learning to predict outcomes following thoracic and complex endovascular aortic aneurysm repair" by Li and colleagues. The code was written in R verison 4.3.1.
